## 💡 TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### ✅ Do These:

1. **Start Small**
   - Week 1: Just use Dashboard + Inbox
   - Week 2: Add Habits (3 max)
   - Week 3: Add Energy Log
   - Week 4: Add Time Blocking
   - Month 2: Add Weekly Reviews

2. **Same Time, Same Place**
   - Morning review: Always 7am at desk
   - Evening shutdown: Always 5:30pm
   - Weekly review: Always Sunday 7pm
   - Build the habit location

3. **Make It Easy**
   - Pin Personal Dashboard in Obsidian
   - Set phone reminders:
     * 7:00am "Morning Review"
     * 5:30pm "Evening Shutdown"
     * 9:00pm "Update Habits"
     * Sunday 7pm "Weekly Review"

4. **Review, Don't Just Track**
   - Tracking without reviewing is useless
   - The insight comes from patterns
   - Weekly reviews are non-negotiable

5. **Adapt the System**
   - These are templates, not laws
   - Remove what doesn't work
   - Add what you need
   - Your system should fit YOU

### ❌ Avoid These:

1. **Trying to do everything at once**
   - You'll burn out
   - Start with just Dashboard + Inbox

2. **Making it complicated**
   - Simple > Perfect
   - "Good enough" system you use > Perfect system you don't

3. **Skipping reviews**
   - The reviews are where insights happen
   - No review = no improvement

4. **Beating yourself up**
   - Missed a day? Start again tomorrow
   - Habits at 50%? Better than 0%
   - Progress > Perfection

5. **Organizing during capture**
   - Capture fast, organize later
   - Inbox is for dumping, not sorting

## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I'm not using the system"
→ **It's too complicated.** Simplify.
→ Start with JUST Dashboard + Inbox for 2 weeks.
→ Add one thing at a time.

### "I keep forgetting"
→ **Set phone reminders** for each routine.
→ Put sticky note on laptop: "Did you check Dashboard?"
→ Pair with existing habit (after coffee = dashboard time).

### "I don't have time"
→ **You're spending time anyway**, just not intentionally.
→ Morning routine: 10 min. Evening: 15 min. That's 25 min to organize your entire day.
→ 25 min of planning saves hours of confusion.

### "It feels rigid"
→ **These are guidelines, not rules.**
→ Adapt everything to fit you.
→ Some people need structure, others need flexibility.
→ Use what helps, ignore what doesn't.

### "I'm not seeing results"
→ **Are you doing weekly reviews?** That's where insights come from.
→ Give it 4 weeks minimum.
→ Results compound slowly.
