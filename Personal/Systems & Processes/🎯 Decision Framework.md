**The Newspaper Test**
*Would I be comfortable if this decision was on the front page?*


**The Best Friend Test**
*What would I advise my best friend to do?*


**The Reverse Test**
*If I had already chosen option A, would I switch to option B?*


### Step 6: Consider the Costs

**Opportunity cost:**
*What am I giving up by choosing this?*


**Second-order consequences:**
*What happens after what happens?*


**Worst-case scenario:**
*Can I handle it?*

## 🚫 Common Decision Traps to Avoid

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
❌ "I've already invested so much, I can't quit now"
✅ Look forward, not backward. Past costs are irrelevant.

### Analysis Paralysis
❌ Waiting for perfect information
✅ Set a deadline. Decide with 70% information.

### Decision Fatigue
❌ Making important decisions when tired
✅ Schedule big decisions in the morning

### Social Proof Bias
❌ "Everyone else is doing it"
✅ What's right for them may not be right for me

### Confirmation Bias
❌ Only looking for information that supports my preference
✅ Actively seek disconfirming evidence

### Status Quo Bias
❌ Choosing inaction because it's comfortable
✅ "Do nothing" should be an active choice, not default

### FOMO
❌ Saying yes to everything
✅ Every yes to something is a no to something else
