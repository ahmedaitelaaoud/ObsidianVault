## 💡 Tips for Better Capture

**Good capture habits:**
- Write fast, organize later
- One line per thought
- Date your captures
- Use bullet points
- Add context if needed (where/when/why)
- Process within 48 hours

**Question prompts for unclear captures:**
- What was I thinking?
- Why is this important?
- What's the next action?
- Where does this belong?
- Is this still relevant?

**Capture triggers:**
- During conversations
- After meetings
- Reading articles/books
- Watching videos
- In the shower (keep phone nearby!)
- Before sleeping
- During walks

*Remember: The best system is the one you actually use. Capture fast, process later.*
